### NYC citibike Analysis, 2019

In 2019, approximately 20 million citibike rides were used in New York City. A 10% representative sample of this dataset was used to analyze top trends of these rides throughout the year. 

Maps of the most popular start and stop stations reveal that stations below 60th Street are most frequently used.  The popularity of start and stop stations are nearly identical - as shown by the top 10 lists. This is potentially due to the proximity of the citibike stations to colleges and/or subway stations. 

In analyzing male and female ridership, we see that the proportion of male ridership far outweighs female ridership by nearly three-fold in every age category. Furthermore, males subscribe  to an anual membership at a higher degree than females, albeit only slightly. However, regarding the time of day of rides, both male and female  display similar behaviors, with morning and evening rush hours being the most popular times to ride. 

Throughout the year, we see that ridership increases with warmer weather, with the hours between 12pm and 3pm being the most popular times to ride during all seasons. As well, weekdays saw more ridership than weekends (with the exception of the month of June), likely due to the fact that a lot of riders use citibike during work days.

The average trip duration was higher in warmer months, with longer rides between April and September. Furthermore, riders tend to be more leisurely with their citibikes on weekends. Females prefer to ride longer than males on a monthly basis.
